## AGSA
The Agronomy Graduate Student Association (AGSA) is a collection of graduate students representing many disciplines within the Department of Agronomy at Kansas State University. Our goal is to support and facilitate the efforts of graduate students involved in the study of agronomy by providing special opportunities which enhance educational and personal development. Annual fundraising efforts allow the AGSA to offer exclusive scholarships to its members and invite guest speakers to give presentations that are of special interest to the club.

The mission of the Agronomy Graduate Student Association is to allow students to:

1. Become acquainted with all agronomy graduate students.
2. Become familiar with the research project of each agronomy graduate student and better understand the scope of the graduate research program of agronomy.
3. Sponsor projects within the Department of Agronomy that will enhance the graduate agronomy program.
4. Support Department of Agronomy activities contributing to the graduate program.

## AGSA - Applied Stats & Programming Committee
Data analysis is one of the cornerstones of good research. The analysis workflow spans from acquiring the data, data curation, and end exploratory data analysis to statistical hypothesis testing and creating results figures. Currently, a vast number of techniques could be implemented for each step, plus a growing number of statistical software. However, it is crucial that current graduate students (i.e., future leading scientists and researchers) understand all statistical workflow components.

This committee aims to organize lectures, workshops, speeches, and/or visits to improve the studentsâ€™ understanding of statistics and how to program models. It is designated to anyone who desires to enhance their data analysis skills and assist colleagues.
